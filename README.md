# Selected projects - Lam Ngo

## Introduction
Dear potential employer,
this repository contains a few selected projects that demonstrate my programming ability in data science.

## DockerDatabase
This project uses docker, python (including flask), SQL and MongoDB. The frontend is built with Javascript and HTML/CSS (focus was on the backend components though, website looks unpolished). Random data is generated and inserted into a SQL database. One can modify this data by adding new entries through the website. The data can then be transferred to a MongoDB database. The programme is containerized with Docker.  The goal of this project was to combine all these different tools.


## MatrixFactorization
This project was part of my thesis on "Interpretable representation of latent variables in matrix factorizations". It uses matrix factorization [^1] to predict students' answers to mathematical questions [^2]. Pytorch was used for the implementation.
